i need to take the time that the train started running and when it is coming next regardless of what time it is. if i start from basic 12 maybe will be easier.


i have a train running every 15 minutes. it is currently 3:26 am. how many time has the train run?

3 hours and 26 minutes have passed
convert to minutes = 206 minutes
divide by train frequency = 206/15

#trains=13.73...

i have a train running every 9(frequency) minutes. it is currently 4:35 am(time). when will the next train arrive?
start time = 0:00
find hours past start time = 4hour
convert it to minutes = 4*60= 240hourMinutes
add minutes = 240+35 = 275totalMinutes
divide totalMinutes by trainFrequency = totalMinutes/frequency = 30.555trainRuns...
take remainder and multiply by frequency = .555*9 =4.995extraMinutes
round to nearest whole minute =5extraMinutes
extraMinute+time=4:40amnextTrain
